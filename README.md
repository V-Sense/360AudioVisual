In this repository, we are sharing our developed 360-degree Audio-Visual Dataset (360AVD) that we hope will foster further research in multimedia signal processing area. This repository contains materials for the paper: *Towards generating ambisonics using audio-visual cue for virtual reality*

### Abstract
will be available after the paper acceptance
### Results
will be available after the paper acceptance

### Downloads
