This is additional material for the QoMEX paper: Visual Attention in Omnidirectional Video for Virtual Reality Applications

### Abstract
Understanding of visual attention is crucial for *omnidirectional video (ODV)* viewed for instance with a head-mounted display (HMD), where only a fraction of an ODV is rendered at a time. Transmission and rendering of ODV can be optimized by understanding how viewers consume a given ODV in virtual reality (VR) applications. In order to predict video regions that might draw the attention of viewers, *saliency maps* can be estimated by using computational visual attention models. As no such model currently exists for ODV, but given the importance for emerging ODV applications, we create a new visual attention user dataset for ODV, investigate behavior of viewers when consuming the content, and analyze the prediction performance of state-of-the-art visual attention models. Our developed test-bed and dataset will be publicly available with this paper, to stimulate and support research on ODV.
